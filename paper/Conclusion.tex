\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{Conclusion}
We presented \crossrec, a scalable and private heterogeneous recommender. 
\crossrec leverages a novel similarity metric \graphsim, identifying similar items across domains, to generate AlterEgo profiles of users in a domain where they might not have any activity yet. We presented private as well as non-private versions of \crossrec: both perform better in terms of recommendation quality than alternative heterogeneous recommenders~\cite{baltrunas2009context,lemire2005slope,berkovsky2007cross,sarwar2001item, cremonesi2011cross}. (Although, not surprisingly, there is a trade-off between quality and privacy). 

%To conclude, it is important to notice that we addressed the heterogeneous recommendation problem leveraging \emph{user overlap}. The heterogeneous recommendation with \emph{no overlap} between the domains   remains an open problem~\cite{cremonesi2014cross}.
